Shim repository for my fork of [easyXDM](https://github.com/oyvindkinsey/easyXDM).

[My fork of easyXDM](https://github.com/nevans54/easyXDM) provides the ability to supply a context to exposed remote functions.

This package provides the built version of easyXDM. The easyXDM source gets compiled with [ant](https://github.com/apache/ant).
